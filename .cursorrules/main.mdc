I'm building "The Pool" - a visual space for finding conversation partners at events.

Tech stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Supabase (Auth, Database, pgvector)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- OpenAI API (embeddings)
- TypeScript

Design:
- Dark theme (bg: #0a0a0f)
- Accent: blue (#3b82f6)
- Pool colors: purple (#a855f7) → green (#22c55e) gradient by match score

Keep code simple and minimal. No over-engineering.
